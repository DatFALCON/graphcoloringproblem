# Graph Coloring Problem Solution with Python


Graph/Map coloring is a subset of graph labeling in graph theory; it involves the assignment of labels to elements of a graph that are traditionally referred to as "colors" under specific conditions. In its most basic form, it is a method of coloring a graph's vertices so that no two neighboring vertices are the same color.

The solution of this problem was made by taking the idea from the greedy algorithm.

Networkx and Matplotlib libraries has been used for this project to show up the solution with visualization.
